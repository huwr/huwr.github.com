            <h3>Ingredients</h3>

              <li>450 g large prawns with shells</li>
              <li>1 tsp salt</li>
              <li>1.2 L cold water</li>

            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <p>Peel and devein the prawns.  Wash the prawns, and the shells, very thoroughly. Put the prawns on a plate, sprinkle with half the salt and keep in the fridge until needed.  Put the shells aside.</p>
            <p>Put the water into a large saucepan with the tamarind slices, chillies, kaffir lime leaves, ginger, galingale, lemon grass and the rest of the salt.  Bring this to the boil and simmer for 20 to 30 minutes.  By this time the stock will be very fragrant from the lemon grass and other aromatic ingredients.</p>
            <p>In a small saucepan, heat the oil and fry the chopped onion until soft, then add the prawn shells and stir for about 2 minutes. Put the onion and prawn shells, without any oil, into the stock pot. Continue to simmer for 15 minutes. Then strain the stock through a fine sieve, or a sieve lined with muslin, into another large saucepan.  Discard the solids.  Add the chicken stock, if used, or water or vegetable stock (this additional liquid is needed if the soup is to serve 6 people).  Keep aside to reheat later.</p>
            <p>While the hot and sour stock is brewing, prepare the vegetables. Peel the carrots and white radish and cut them into thin rounds.  If the white radish is very large, cut the rounds in half.  Pick over and wash the mustard greens or watercress.  Shred the oyster mushrooms. If using dried mushrooms, soak these in boiling water for 30 minutes, then remove the stalks; put the stalks and the water into the stock pot. Slice the mushrooms, which are now quite soft.</p>
            <p>Put the clear and strained stock to boil gently. Add the carrots and white radish and mushrooms.  Simmer for 10 minutes. Increase the heat and bring the stock to a rolling boil, then add the prawns. Let the mixture boil for 3 minutes, and add the mustard greens or watercress and fish sauce. Cook for the soup for just <i>one</i> more minute, then serve immediately.</p>
