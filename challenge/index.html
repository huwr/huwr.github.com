<p><em>By Huw</em></p>

<p><strong>Prize:</strong> Bounty of $50 and everlasting fame.</p>

<p>There are three problems.  They start simple and get progressively more complex.  The first person to send to me the correct plaintext for all three (which includes their reasoning and explanations for the answers) will be the winner.</p>

<h2 id="rules">Rules</h2>

<ul>
<li><p>There is a solution to each problem in plain English (Commonwealth spelling), Roman letters, no punctuation and no case.  </p></li>
<li><p>I won&#8217;t confirm the correctness of the answers.  You will know if you have it right because it will be a proper English sentence.</p></li>
<li><p>You may not use a computer program unless you write it yourself (and send me the source / method with your answer.)</p></li>
<li><p>You only may share the work if you agree to share the bounty equally.</p></li>
<li><p>If no one gets all three, half the bounty will go to whoever&#8217;s first with two of any of the answers.  If no one gets at least two answers, there will be no bounty awarded to anyone.  You may as well send the answers to me as you come up with them.</p></li>
<li><p>These rules might change subtly. The main thrust of them is consistent and the ciphertext won&#8217;t change. See the <strong>changes</strong> section.</p></li>
<li><p>I&#8217;m the judge.</p></li>
</ul>
