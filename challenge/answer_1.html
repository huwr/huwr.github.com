<p><em>By Huw</em></p>

<p>This was a simple <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ROT13">rot 13</a> cipher.  It works simply by replacing each letter with the letter 13 places further in the alphabet.</p>

<p>The cipher is arranged into letter blocks of 5.  The last block is padded out with X.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Far away a voice is calling, <br />
Bells from memory do chime <br />
Come home again, come home again, <br />
They call through the oceans of time.</p>

<p>Well keep a welcome in the hillside. <br />
Well keep a welcome in the Vales <br />
This land you knew will still be singing <br />
When you come home again to Wales.</p>

<p>This land of song will keep a welcome <br />
And with a love that never fails, <br />
We'll kiss away each hour of hiraeth <br />
When you come home again to Wales.</p>
</blockquote>

<p><strong>NB:</strong> the word &#8216;hiraeth&#8217; has no direct English translation.  It is a Welsh word meaning patriotic nostalgia.</p>
