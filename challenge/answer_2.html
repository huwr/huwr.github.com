<p><em>By Huw</em></p>

<p>This is a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polyalphabetic_cipher">polyalphabetic cipher</a>.  It is very similar to the solution for the first cipher, but it uses multiple alphabets.  </p>

<p>The first letter is shifted by some amount, the second by a different amount, and so on, in sets of 5.  The amount each letter is shifted is determined by a key.  The solution to the first cipher gave away the key word: WALES.  </p>

<p>This was the most challenging of the three ciphers.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>If you can keep your head when all about you <br />
  Are losing theirs and blaming it on you, <br />
  If you can trust yourself when all men doubt you, <br />
  But make allowance for their doubting too; <br />
  If you can wait and not be tired by waiting, <br />
  Or being lied about, don&#8217;t deal in lies, <br />
  Or being hated, don&#8217;t give way to hating, <br />
  And yet don&#8217;t look too good, nor talk too wise:  </p>
</blockquote>

<p>This is the first stanza of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/If—">If—</a>, a poem by Rudyard Kipling in 1895.</p>
