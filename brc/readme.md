BRC Site
========

This is just a demo site for the ACT Rovers BRC.  It's static, and not at all easy to edit.  It's really just showing what the thing could look like.

I'm using Bootstrap by Twitter.  Look in the copyright.html file for more stuff about that.

Deployment
---------

Just copy it to some directory somewhere on a webserver.  Then: you're off.
