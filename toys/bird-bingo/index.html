          Using fancy pants <a href="http://jquerymobile.com/">jQuery Mobile</a> I created a bit of a small app for my rovers.  It's not very helpful to them.  And
          you probably won't find it helpful either.  But nonetheless I only made it for the joy of learning about jQuery Mobile over an hour or two one afternoon. 
          I really like jQuery Mobile.  If you're writing a rich JavaScript web app then you should definitely consider it.
        </p>
        <p>
          I say it's an iPhone app, but I should point out at this stage that it works also on Android and WP7 phones, too.  It'll probably work pretty well in your
          desktop browser, actually.  I'm also aware that there are a few bugs and they are problems with my app, not with jQuery Mobile or the browsers.

          I have been using <a href="http://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a> for a while.  I really like it.  A problem with products like Microsoft Word is that it
          fails to separate the two concerns of writing and typesetting.  That is, it muddles up the writing of a thoughtful essay with the document's typesetting and
          layout.
        </p>
        <p>
          In LaTeX, however, an author writes a document in plain text, free of the distraction of typesetting and layout.  It's something of a markup language. 
          When finished writing, or ready to make a draft, the author take the plain text and runs LaTeX to typeset.  Simply put the text into the sections and it takes
          it all sorts out fonts, typeface, links, tables of contents, et cetera for you, so that you don't have to.  The best thing is it's always good looking.
        </p>
        <p>
          I've been doing it for ages, and I take great joy in fiddling with the corners of it.  Loads of people find that aspect tedious.  I totally understand that. 
          Hopefully my template will prove useful to you.
