Tomâ€™s speech for his wedding

* thank you all for coming

* thank you to Ben Biddington, my best man
	- we agreed to be best men for each other at 12
	- on delivering the best man speech for him I remember thinking `this is quite possibly the most significant speech I'll ever make, unless I get married'
	- here I am!

* thank you to my other groomsmen
	- all had big influences on my life
	- I'm proud to make them wear a suit

* thanks to Bill Bradley	
	- for hosting this evening
	- for his daughter's hand in marriage
	- can't use a phone to ask
	- asking Bill in Brisbane was slightly complicated and required covert skills
	- Amanda was convinced I was in Sydney; I even had a Sydney flight number for the return journey
	- Simon is in the audience; I convinced him in the QANTAS lounge that I was off for work too

* thanks to Mum and Dad
	- for an excellent upbringing
	- and putting up with me so far
	- it's largely Dad's fault that I went about a PhD
	- don't; it's a bad idea

* the PhD was always a pre-requisite
	- I thought two big projects was one too many
	- we'd talked about getting married
	- but saying it wouldn't happen until I'd submitted helped with the surprise

* which brings me to

* thank you to Amanda for saying yes
	- not that her agreeing was too hard
	- the best questions are those to which you know the answer

* but getting a chance to ask was
	- how do you ask?
	- dinner at home for Amanda's birthday
	- which kept being delayed
	- she missed out on a longer engagement through no fault of mine

* I am very lucky to have
	- such a beautiful wife
	- who is sharp and intelligent
	- fun to be around and enjoys watching politics programmes on Sundays
	- who takes such excellent care of me by taking me to live in continental Europe

* finally, I'd like to propose a toast
	- I'm sure you'll all join with me in a toast to Julia, Monica, Kate and Bee who were of a huge support to Amanda in preparation of this occasion
	- to the bridesmaids
