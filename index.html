        </div>
        
        <div class="row">
          <div class="col-md-3 col-sm-4">
            <h3>Ingredients</h3>
            <ul class="ingredients">
              <li>60 g butter</li>
              <li>1/2 cup castor sugar</li>
              <li>dash vanilla essence</li>

              <li>1 tablespoon cocoa</li>
              <li>1 cup self-raising flour</li>

            <h3>Procedure</h3>
            <h5>Topping</h5><p>Combine in a saucepan and heat until boiling the following: 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon cocoa, 1 1/2 cup boiling water</p>
            
            <h5>Main</h5><p>Cream butter, sugar and essence.  Add egg, beat until fluffy.  Fold in half the sifted cocoa and self-raising flour then cut in half the mix.  Repeat with remaining flour, cocoa and milk mix.  Pour mixture into a 1.5 litre capacity oven proof baking dish (not a spring-form pan).  Carefully pour the topping over the cake batter.  Bake in a hot oven for 30-40 minutes (the cake batter will rise to the surface and the topping will form a sauce underneath).  Serve hot</p>
