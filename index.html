      There used to be a bit more on this site, and maybe one day there will be again. In the mean time, there is a lovely chocolate sauce pudding recipe for you to try. It’s one of my favourites.

        <h3>Chocolate Sauce Pudding</h3>
        <p>What a grand recipe. Don’t use a spring-form pan. Once, I was making this pudding for a girl I liked and I made it in a spring-form pan. It leaked. It leaked all over the bench. It went through each of the kitchen drawers… Despite that, we eventually got married.</p>

          <h3>Ingredients</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>60 g butter</li>
            <li>1/2 cup castor sugar</li>
            <li>dash vanilla essence</li>
            <li>1 egg</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon cocoa</li>
            <li>1 cup self-raising flour</li>
            <li>1 cup milk</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
        <div>
          <h3>Procedure</h3>
          <h5>Topping</h5>
          <p>Combine in a saucepan and heat until boiling the following: 1/2 cup sugar, 1 tablespoon cocoa, 1 1/2 cup boiling water</p>
  
          <h5>Main</h5>
          <p>Cream butter, sugar and essence. Add egg, beat until fluffy. Fold in half the sifted cocoa and self-raising flour. Repeat with remaining flour, cocoa and milk mix. Pour mixture into a 1.5 litre capacity oven proof baking dish (not a spring-form pan). Carefully pour the topping over the cake batter. Bake in a hot oven for 30-40 minutes (the cake batter will rise to the surface and the topping will form a sauce underneath). Serve hot</p>
